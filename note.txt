🧩 1. What is a ViewSet?
A ViewSet is a class that groups together multiple actions you want your API to support — like:

GET /items/ → show all items

GET /items/1/ → show one item

POST /items/ → create a new item

PUT /items/1/ → update an item

DELETE /items/1/ → delete an item

🔁 2. What are Mixins?
Mixins are like ready-made features you can add to a ViewSet.

Each mixin gives one ability:

Mixin	What it does
CreateModelMixin	Lets users create (POST)
ListModelMixin	Lets users see a list (GET)
RetrieveModelMixin	Lets users see one item (GET by ID)
UpdateModelMixin	Lets users update (PUT/PATCH)
DestroyModelMixin	Lets users delete (DELETE)

✅ You only include the mixins you need, and Django handles the URLs & logic.
